# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio.  It started as a few projects to learn python, and has progressed to cover business focussed case studies using common machine learning and statistical algorithms.  The portfolio is structured as a website to more easily explain the approach to each case study, as well as looking at the code and the results.  

Each post also has a summary in case you just want the tl/dr ;)
