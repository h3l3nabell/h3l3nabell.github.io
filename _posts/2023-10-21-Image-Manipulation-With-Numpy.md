## introduction
In this post I'm going to explore using Python and Numpy only to manipulate a jpg image.   I'll be using skimage to import the image, and matplotlib as well, to render it so I can see what's happening.  I'll be using the typical naming conventions for these packages, to make it easier for people familiar with them to read the code.

Let's start with our basic image file which is a jpeg.

```ruby
import numpy as np
from skimage import io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



```




I hope you've enjoyed this little exploration into Planets, Python and Numpy.  Rest assured we will be exploring Numpy functionality further in later posts.
